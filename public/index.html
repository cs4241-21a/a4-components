          Welcome to the Post-COVID Pizza Party Planner (PCPPP for short)!
          COVD-19 has taken parties away for 2 years now leading to people
          <strong>forgetting</strong> how to throw an awesome pizza party. This website was designed so you don't have to stress about your lost
          knowledge! Just follow the instructions below and you'll be on your
          way to pizza party success!
        </p>

        <p class="instructions">
          All we need from you is how many people are coming, how many of those
          people are gluten free, and how many slices you want each person to
          have! From there we'll let you know how many small, mediums, and
          larges you'll need<span>&#42;</span> (including how many gf options
          you'll need available).
        </p>

      <h2 class = "tableH">Pizza Party Log:</h2>
      <table id="t1" role:"table">
        <tr>
          <th>Total People</th>
          <th>Slices Per Person</th>
          <th>Total gf People</th>
          <th>Total Large</th>
          <th>Total Meduim</th>
          <th>Total Small</th>

          <span>&#42;</span>This goes off the assumption that where you order
          from has 8-10" smalls, 12" mediums, and 14" larges. The PCPPP is not
          responsible for any pizza party mishaps that come from ordering
          different sized pizzas.
