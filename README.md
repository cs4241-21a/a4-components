Assignment 4 - Components

This is mostly the same project I did before. I changed the entire frontend to use React, with Login, Register, and the main app all being unique objects. Functionally, it is largely the same as assignment A3. I don't think it improved nor hindered the development process, as my application did not depend on an object-oriented format. The main issues I ran into were related to having to interpret React-related syntax, such as needing to properly call certain methods to find the right requests. Some of the more odd issues were changing onClick to onSubmit and making a unique variable in place of this due to Javascript weirdness. I'd say that React could be more efficient if I were to build an application on it from the ground up, but converting it without prior knowledge of the application system was a bit confusing and frustrating at times.

Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

Unlike previous assignments, this assignment will be solely graded on whether or not you successfully complete it. Partial credit will be generously given.
