## Car Registry

Glitch Link: http://a4-evan-llewellyn.glitch.me

This app allows users to register their car online by filling out a form with relavent information about their car, which then populates the table and updates the server. They can also delete rows from the table if they made a mistake or no longer own that car. For this project, I converted my A2 assignment to use React. I think that this new technology vastly improved the development experience. I didn't have to think about grabbing variables from the DOM since they were being saved in the props of the child component. I also like how you can dynamically update the table with the map function on the array that is saved in the App state.
