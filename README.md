##Reactive Log

I remade a2 with react. This application lets you add modify and delete rows of data poertaining to chores, the people who should be doing them, and the completion status. It uses react to update the table rather than inner html.

I found it quite challenging to update the old program and in hindsite it probably would have been better to restart from the ground up.
