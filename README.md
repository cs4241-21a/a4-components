The Book Keeper application is designed to keep track of the books that you have read. The application includes the title of the book, the author of the book, the user's rating of the book on a scale of 1 (worst) - 5 (best), any additional notes about the book, and the year the book was read by the user. This application is a modified version of that from a2 using React and Express. 

Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
I think that the new technology overall helped the development experience. This is because it streamlined the table processes. For instance, not having to make as many helper functions for updating the table every time a book is added to the database. I also liked how all the html for the table and whatnot was all in the same file, no need for an main html page and manually add html elements in the javascript file. The only hinderance was how I have never programmed using React before so there was a bit of a learning curve when it came to this assignment.
