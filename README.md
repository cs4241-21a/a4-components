In order to complete this assignment, I replaced all frontend javascript with react. Any elements that are dynamically generated are also created using the react class structure. I took the App and Todo class structure from the lecture example for the forum table, with the table representing the App object and each forum entry representing the Todo object. I found the new technology to both improve and hinder the development experience. For static elements (like the submit entry button) I found react to be fairly annoying to use. It was difficult to get the button's onclick method set up properly. On the other hand, it was much cleaner and easier to set up the dynamic table. A method that was nearly 100 lines in my a3 is now under 20 due to the for each style that has build in html. It was especially useful as I didn't need a massive amount of lines dedicated to setting attributes of elements.
