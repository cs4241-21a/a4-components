Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

This project is basically my reimplementation of the GenshinDB; except, I added a few more fields such as description and star. If you are unfamiliar with GenshinDB, it is a database which keeps track of your Genshin Impact characters. I did also change it to card form to give each character its individual space.

I also used FireBase instead of MongoDB. However, I was unable to get Delete to work. Nevertheless, React was fun to use and I enjoyed learning it! 

I believe the new technology improved my development experience. Being able to write HTML code in a .js file allowed for many implementations which were harder to do before. The only hinderance React gave was familiarizing myself with it (especially while trying to catch up from my sick missed work). After spending 2 to 3 days reviewing React, I saw how powerful it was.
