Assignment 4 - Components
===

Due: October 4th, by 11:59 AM.

For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of *either* A2 or A3 using either React or Svelte components. If you choose A3 you only need to use components for the data display / updating; you can leave your login UI as is.

[Svelte Tutorial](https://github.com/cs4241-21a/cs4241-21a.github.io/blob/main/using_svelte.md)  
[React Tutorial](https://github.com/cs4241-21a/cs4241-21a.github.io/blob/main/using_react.md)  

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.), however, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them.

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Implement your project with the above requirements.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page on Glitch/Heroku/etc., it displays correctly.
4. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a4-firstname-lastname` so we can find it.
5. Fork this repository and modify the README to the specifications below. Be sure to add *all* project files.
6. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Name the pull request using the following template: `a4-firstname-lastname`.

Sample Readme (delete the above when you're ready to submit, and modify the below so with your links and descriptions)

This is mostly the same project I did before. I changed the entire frontend to use React, with Login, Register, and the main app all being unique objects. Functionally, it is largely the same as assignment A3. I don't think it improved nor hindered the development process, as my application did not depend on an object-oriented format. The main issues I ran into were related to having to interpret React-related syntax, such as needing to properly call certain methods to find the right requests. Some of the more odd issues were changing onClick to onSubmit and making a unique variable in place of this due to Javascript weirdness. I'd say that React could be more efficient if I were to build an application on it from the ground up, but converting it without prior knowledge of the application system was a bit confusing and frustrating at times.

Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

Unlike previous assignments, this assignment will be solely graded on whether or not you successfully complete it. Partial credit will be generously given.
