This project was a rework of assignment a2 using ReactJS for the front-end instead of HTML and native JavaScript. The changes that I made included getting rid of the front-end JS files that I had and moving it into React component classes. In my App.jsx, you will see that I have two classes, one for the App and one for the "review" component. The "review" component refers to the individual reviews and a review component will be appended to the table when there is a change in the state (something is sent from the server).  

As far as working with React, I definitely think there is a learning curve when starting. It is a little difficult going from native JS to a React-based project. However, I do see the benefits of having your JS and HTML all in one file (although you can do the same with an inline JS script). Apart from that, one of the biggest benefits is that your code becomes very maintainable and reuseable because components can be moved around and used in different files. I had a difficult time working with the setting of the state because the state refers to the "this" context of the app and it becomes unpleasant when one needs to change the state from a different component which is what I had to do. Overall, I think as I become more accustomed to developing with React it will get easier.
