## Event Itinerary (React)

Glitch: http://a4-nicholas-frangie.glitch.me

This project utilizes form interactions, dynamic table contents, and a mongoDB database to provide users a tool to manage their agenda with an interactive, online event itinerary capable of recording event details. As part of assignment 4, HTML form presentation and JS scripting has been refactored into React elements capable of combining related functionality in a much cleaner way for the developer. 

The React Technology improved the development experience and was suprisingly simple to transtion to from pure JavaScript. The hardest challenge certainly was the separation of integrated systems between distinct elements: making the table, buttons, and form interact with one another was certainly difficult, given how functionality in one components might alter the state of another. Overall, I would say the technology provided great benefits in abstracting related functionality so that the form and function of singular components wasn't separated by the nature of HTML & JS.
