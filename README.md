## Online Food Ordering Using React

## Changes from A2 ##
I took into account the feedback I received from assignment #2 and added a function that includes AM or PM in the time placed and expected dropoff time table cells. Other than that the styling I kept essentially the same except some minor accessibility changes taken from assignment #3. This site is also being hosted on heroku compared to assignment #2 which is hosted on glitch.

## Using React ##
Using React was really difficult at first and almost felt like trying to learn an entirely new language, but after a while it was easy enough to get the hang of. It made integrating portions from HTML and JS much easier than normal seeing as they're basically combined now. It felt less jumbled and using components made code more easy to understand. Developing this version of the Online Food Ordering site was much quicker than any other version prior.
