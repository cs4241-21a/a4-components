https://a4-jingyu-xie.glitch.me

Introduction
---
  - This single-page app will generate a servant with given name and occupation immediately after add button being clicked 
  - Several attributes will be generated randomly based on occupation chosen, and it will vary between (EX, A++, A+, A, A-, A--, B, C, D, E)

Changes
---
Compared to previous version in a2, this project have several changes:
- Servants exists will be automatically read and post to the page at the beginning, so users don't have to click on "Show Exist Servants" to see existing servants
- The add form for new servants is right under the picture, so users don't have to click on "add" button to show the add form

Question Answering

Speaking from a wide perspective, the technology helps a lot in simplifying the code structure and making it easy to read. 
But sometimes it hinder me a little bit. I am not sure whether it's the react's problem, but it seemed that the grid didn't work in react. Also, bullet point selection didn't work.
