Assignment 4 - Components (React)

## Internet Lurkers in The Database

I kept the assingment very similar to my A2 -> https://humane-certain-bromine.glitch.me/, although I changed the placement of my input text boxes to be more central, made the font a little nicer to look at, and also now the data in the server is saved and displayed even after refreshing the page. (as well as converting the whole client to react)

I thought the new technology made my experience a lot easier. This might be biased though, because I have learned a lot about web development through a2, a3, the reading, and class lectures over that period of time. I enjoyed the flexibility to deploy a client that behaved more functionally. I also enjoyed the fact that a block of client code could be instantiated multiple times using react, this could save me a lot of time in the future.
