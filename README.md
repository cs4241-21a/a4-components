Assignment 4 - Components (React)

## Internet Lurkers in The Database

I kept the assingment very similar to my A2 -> https://humane-certain-bromine.glitch.me/, although I changed the placement of my input text boxes to be more central and made the font a little nicer to look at. 

I thought the new technology made my experience a lot easier. This might be biased though, because I have learned a lot about web development through a2, a3, the reading, and class lectures over that period of time. I enjoyed the flexibility to deploy a client that behaved more functionally. I also enjoyed the fact that black of client code could be instantiated multiple times using react , this could save me a lot of time in the future.
