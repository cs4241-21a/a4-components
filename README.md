## League of Legends Team Sign Up Form

This is a very basic sign up form, you enter your information and press submit and it will display it on the table. The main change I made from A2 was reworking how the website loaded the sign up form and I had it remove the sign up form after the user inputted their data. 

Using react initially was very confusing, I had trouble understanding how hook functions actually worked. Once I got the hang of using it, I found things much easier and to be more intuitive than my initial functions for adding information to the table. THe main thing that I struggled with and eventually had to drop was having it save and display multiple users inputs. Overall, using react ended up feeling a lot easier and the code ended up looking much nicer than my previous projects functions.
