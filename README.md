This is pretty much the same as my assignment 3. The only real change is that when you click on the table headers to sort, it will sort a little more logically, as well as reverse sorting direction when you click it again. Overall I would say that Svelte improved my development experience. Having already made the website in vanilla js made it a bit of a strange experience, in a lot of places the code was just copied from the other project without much work to "svelte-ify" it. That being said, svelte substantially simplified certain aspects of the website, particuarly the table. Being able to have loops in the html make it very simple to get a simple table of data. The main challenge I had with svelte (that is a challenge for all javascript frameworks) is when data or information needs to move in a way that isn't directly up or down the component tree (like populating the fields of the modify book modal with the current values or the book you are modifying). Overall svelte seems pretty nice, at least in the context of small projects.
