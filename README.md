Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

What I have changed from Assignment 3, is that now Assignment 4 uses React components for the client side of the application. 
I re-wrote the client side of the application using React's JavaScript framework. I noticed that 
the home page renders the add, modify, and delete actions much faster due to React's virtual DOM. The 'this.state' variable allows the user to pass and store user input without using querySelector.
