My application is a tip calculator, that allows individuals to easily calculate the tip and evenly determine the price each person in the party would pay. While I decided to keep the css framework (Bootstrap) that I had used A3, I decided to refactor A2. This project, now has uses multiple nested react classes allowing for the majority of the html, to be reused. I think that overall my development experience was improved, however I did struggle a lot to find a way to incorporate different features as easily as I was able to with normal java script. I think the code is a lot more organized using React but takes a lot more time.
