The application is a simple contact logging system for users. This can be used for contact tracing, possibly for COVID, or for keeping an up-to-date list of personal or work-related connections. The app implements a MongoDB server for user creation and data storage. React was used in unison to build a responsive database system. For CSS, a common framework, called React-Bootrap, was implemented for all the basic needs. React-Bootrap is a free framework with tons of common CSS features, such as Cards and Modal screens. Custom CSS was added to implement the proper Fonts and spacing required for the interface. To run the server, Node, Express, and common middlewares were used for development. Some challenges faced during development were launching the app on Heroku and creating a user registration system. The authentication strategy chosen was a simple Username + Password system. This type of authentication is common across the majority of applications. Changes from a3 include using react, which is a more component-based system, increased server management, and better CSS. React is a framework that relies heavily on components and component-based building blocks. React was used in unison with the backend structure to build a client-side application. React-Bootstrap was implemented for CSS reasons and helped improve the overall look of the website. 


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used Heroku to host the website instead of Glitch.
