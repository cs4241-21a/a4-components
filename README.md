## Flappy Block

I utilized React to generate the leaderboard for the webpage. While my initial assignment 2 had to refresh the page everytime a new entry was added to make it show up on the page React handles those operations very easily. React was not too difficult to implement and I can forsee myself utilizing it again for other projects. I also was able to find faster and easier ways for organizing the rows by rank by sorting the array before it was handed to React.
