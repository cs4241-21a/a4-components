This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Since there are many errors raising when I try to make it run on glitch, I want to apologize in advance, and I don't have a glitch url provided here.

### To Run the Project:
  You need to have two terminals opened. You can do this by clicking split terminal.

  On one terminal, type  `npm start` which allows you to run the project. And it will show that the project is run on http://localhost:3000. However, so far, you are not connected to the server, which means you can't add data to the database. 

  On another terminal, type `node server.js`. And it will show app listening at http://localhost:5000.
  Whenever you add data to the database, this terminal will print out the information that is added to the database.

  A screenshot called `screenshot1.png` is provided in the file.

### Project summary:
  I tried using React and typescript to rewrite a2 in this project. I am new to React and typescript. I only have the add function working so far. I tried doing modify function, but there were many errors raising up, so I didn't add modify function finally. When I was learning React, I followed instructions on React official website where taught me how to build the todolist React demo.

### Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
  To be honest, I don't like React. I am learning Vue and working on MQP this term. Comparing with React, Vue is much easier to understand. They both have the idea of using component which improves the development experience. And I feel like both of them are similar with java. Like in java, we have many classes..... All things are object except primitive data types.
