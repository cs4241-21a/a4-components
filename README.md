## BMI Calculator

My project calculates a user's BMI after they input their name, height and weight and it displays on a table for them to modify or delete. I used assignment 2 as my starting point, and from there, I made an express server with fetch requests for read, add, edit and delete. I also moved all the HTML into the App div/jsx. I used React for the front-end, and while it was okay, I did not think it helped simplify the process too much. I spent too much time trying to figure out how to get the server to run, which was having to change a script in package.json. The practice of using the this keyword for all function calls was also a bit painful because I had to find a way around calling a function inside of an onclick event inside of a function.
