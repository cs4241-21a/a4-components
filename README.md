NOTE: THE PROF GAVE ME AN EXTENSION, HENCE WHY I AM SUBMITTING THIS LATE.

## Brief Summary

I chose to do a4-components and port my a2 into React. I tried to preserve as much of the original website format and functionality as possible, which proved to be a bit annoying to do. Part of my trouble was because I had formatted a2 pretty clumsily, and part of it was because of some subtleties with how React works breaking my project. I probably also committed heinous crimes against React best practices due to not really knowing how to use React properly. It's hard to say if React helped or hindered my process; it certainly went smoother this time around but I think that is largely because I am far more familiar with web development now. I think if I continued to use React in the same way that I am now, it would end up hindering my development. It will take some time for me to learn it before it becomes actually useful.
