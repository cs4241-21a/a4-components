# Reactive Calorie Tracker

This is my __React__ Calorie Tracker application derived from A2, where a user can track their calorie intake by inputing food items, calories per serving, and number of servings consumed. The server derives the total calories for each item based on how many servings were entered. The "Update" form will be filled in automatically upon clicking edit besides an item, and items can also be deleted.  

From my A2 peer feedback, I added a total calorie count for the entire table which automatically refreshes, and I updated the styling to center and widen the content.  

I revamped the entire frontend with React, adding components for the forms, table, table row, and calorie total. Although there was a modest learning curve to implement it, this would definetly benefit the development process in the long term. I liked the Components structure and how code can be modularized away from long html files, and props can be passed as parameters to child components instead. I also enjoyed using the .jsx file type, where I could use a hybrid of html/js.
