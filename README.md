## GTWFin - React

http://a4-gtwfam.glitch.me

The project is a financial app that helps people to keep track of their money inflow and outflow.
In the app, the user can register, login, add and remove the money entries. The money entries with
negative sign would be colored red and the inflow would be colored green. All the money entries are
grouped by months.

Working with React made the development process much easier (less copy pasting same structure) and creates more freedome for creativity. Due to my workload, I wasn't able to add anything new to the project. I am
planning however to expand the application with D3 to create data visualization of the total inflow, outlfow
and more.
