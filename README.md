For this project I reimplemented the client side portion of my A2 assignment using React components. I also ensured that data in the assignment table would persist when a user refreshes the page, or closes then reopens the browser tab.

I would say that the new technology definitely consolidates code and with more concise source files, it is simplier to make any needed modifications. As a whole for this assignment, I would say the development experience was a bit more challenging than anticipated - my workaround was instead of taking my existing project and modifying it to use React, I created a new project and added in the components from A2 as I went. This way I could ensure that in each step of the development process, React was working as intended, as opposed to having to work through a series of errors until the technology was correctly implemented.
