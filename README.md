Not much has changed. I used A2 as after a lot of work to get A3 working with Svelte I had run out of time. All of my functionality from A2 is still there, but things run a little smoother, and the UI has changed ever so slightly to acommodate accessibility. Using Svelte was actually really convenient, when not trying to cobble together my mess of A3 into it. Also the promise handling for tables natively makes it a lot easier to deal with, as well as quicker. My JS was clunky and slow.

Thank you, also, for making this an option instead of just the creative one. I had ideas for the creative one, but this weekend hit me like a truck.
