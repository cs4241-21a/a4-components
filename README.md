The new technology I used for re-developing my A2 assignment is React.js. The purpose of this app is to have users add responses to a survey, see the responses in a table, and be able to edit / delete those responses. React made the development experience intially harder as I was unfamilar with how to utilize it effectively. After loooking up videos online, I got the hang of it and find that React really helps from a development standpoint due to having the HTML embedded inside of JS files. By utilzing hooks, it was much simpler to retrieve data inside the server and manage your webpage. Overall, React has made developing an apps with the requirements of A2 much simplier.
