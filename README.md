Assignment 4 - Components

This is mostly the same project I did before. I changed the entire frontend to use React, with Login, Register, and the main app all being unique objects. Functionally, it is largely the same as assignment A3. I don't think it improved nor hindered the development process, as my application did not depend on an object-oriented format. The main issues I ran into were related to having to interpret React-related syntax, such as needing to properly call certain methods to find the right requests. Some of the more odd issues were changing onClick to onSubmit and making a unique variable in place of this due to Javascript weirdness. I'd say that React could be more efficient if I were to build an application on it from the ground up, but converting it without prior knowledge of the application system was a bit confusing and frustrating at times.
