This is the simple task tracking app I used for assignment 2, only without a results page or a table for the data, instead storin data in a list. It allows the user to enter tasks to do in the future with a description, estimted time to complete, and a due date. It then calculates how long until the task is due.

I would say the new technology slightly hindered the development experience, but noly because this was such a small application. Learning to use react for such a basic app was more work than simply coding it normally would have been at my current level of skill. I can certainly see how for larger projects react could save time writing code, and how ever on this project if I had already been familiar with react I could have finished the project much faster. Really the small scale of the project was the sole reason the use of react seemed to hinder development.
