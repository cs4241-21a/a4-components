(just like with my a2, somehow glitch doesnt like it, i'll attach a video of the code running)

Ever have trouble coming up with a username for your social media? Well this page is here to help! The form takes the user's name and outputs a fun, unique username! I made the background color a nice appealing light pink, and used the Lato font for the whole page (sourced from Google Fonts). These was applied using CSS to the whole body. I also added an image of social media company logos.

I think using react improved the experience by a little bit. It was mostly just a different way to creat the website. But it was nice to have such a fast way to build the webiste. React asll combined the HTML and JS in a simple easy to use way which was beneficial.
