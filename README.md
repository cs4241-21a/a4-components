**a4-Flight Reminder**

I chose to rewrote the front-end client by React. All the express rountes in a3 are changed to API returning json for React to press. The developing process had met some tricky bugs; after check, I realized that React let developers to build the front-end application more logically with modular design. Moreover, it allows user to have more smooth interactions and less jumps and reload on different pages.  

Note: the public folder has re-implemented client files using React.
