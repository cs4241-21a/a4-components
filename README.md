## Life Progression

This web app tells the user how far through the average lifespan you are based on date of brith and sex. I made no changes to the content from A3 and only refactored to use Svelte. Overall I think that using Svelte made the expericene a bit better. The code I wrote was shorter than the Javascript and the formating for the data on the server was much easier to write and understand. Additionally I had to make some changes to my server, naimly converting it to send all of the users data back every time they add, update, or remove a record instead of just sending the modified record. This reduces the amount of thought that has to go into how to format what needs to be sent back to the client. It also means that changes made in a different tab are reflected without having to refresh the page. Overall the experience was better but it was hard to tell how much of that was due to being able to reuse large portions of code.
