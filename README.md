## Database Application

To this project I added React, along with all the necessary tools to develop
with React (for example, snowpack and babel). React makes more sense than I originally anticipated; I'm not sure
if I did everything in the most efficient way, but regardless I can see how it
would improve the development experience as opposed to hinder it. While the
development process was rough personally, learning React seems like a serious
addition to a developers toolkit.

Professor Roberts gave me an extension for this project, due to personal issues
recently. Thank you!
