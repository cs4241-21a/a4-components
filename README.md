# daily expense tracker
[https://a4-yonghua-wang.glitch.me/](https://a4-yonghua-wang.glitch.me/) 

I originally work on a3 and try to convert the entire project to react. However, I end up facing many issue with scoping and binding so I decided to go back to a2 and focus on the 
most fundamental functionality to be able to add item to the table. The app is used to record your daily expense. The total amount and date will be generated by the app itself.

I found the biggest difference between my original code and the new one is that instead of having to concatenating string and setting innerHTML, I can just use templete to pass in
data for a component, which means there are also challenges to handle communication between components. And there seems that no addEventlistner is needed. We can bind the callback inline.

# did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

Instead of React, I prefer Vue as a progressive framework to work with. This gives much more flexibility with existing JS code and paradigm. However, admitedly, framework save a lot of time
from populating/recreating HTML element. This gives much more flexibility to reuse code.
