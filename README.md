Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

The user experience remained exactly the same as assignment 3, with the only changes being to how the HTML is rendered. Using React may have helped a slight bit with the forum and making data entry much easier on the back end, but it significantly hindered the development experience of the dynamically changing table. As React does not allow for dynamically changing rendering within the render function itself, I couldn't find a way in time to change the table by refactoring my table display code to work with react. Personally, while tedious, I found working with HTML/CSS for my specific project significantly easier than working with React, which is why I ended up using a combination of the two.
